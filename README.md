Integrate ceph storage 2 as a backend for OpenStack (Ocata & OSP 8)using Ansible
=======
Integrate ceph storage as a backend for OpenStack using Ansible. 
These Ansible's roles help you to do full installation of Ceph,  OpenStack and integration. 

Roles list:

1- Prepare the machines with require channels and packages,  I assume Red Hat 7 to be installed.

2- Create Ceph cluster,  storage pools and all keys required for OpenStack integration. 

3- Install OpenStack with two nodes(Controller, Compute) to achieve this purpose.

4- Do the integration of ceph with OpenStack. 

Usage :
All you have to do is make some changes on var.yaml in each role based in your requirements,  I encourage you to review each role to be familiar what are exactly do.
